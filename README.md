# NLU 2021 - Riz Luigi - Mat. 223823

The project has been developed using Colab Notebooks [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/RizLuigi/NLU-project/blob/main/GPT2_Evaluation_and_fine_tuning.ipynb). There is no need to worry for the libraries, since the Notebook downloads and includes them directly. Anyway, the used libraries are: 
- [Huggingface Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/):
 
  run ```pip install transformers```
  
- [Huggingface Datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/):
 
  run ```pip install datasets```
  
- [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/):
 
  run ```pip install torch```
  
- [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm):

  run ```pip install tqdm```
  
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/):

    run ```pip install pandas```
    
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/):

    run ```pip install numpy```
  
  
There in no data folder, since the framework manages datasets internally, without the need to download and reload every time.

The report is provided in the main folder.

The "NLU Project" folder contains the checkpoints locally saved in my Google Drive.
